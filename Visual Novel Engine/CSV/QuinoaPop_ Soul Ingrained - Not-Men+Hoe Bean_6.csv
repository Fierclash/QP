3,,Bex,Sad,"Aw, man. Does that mean I have to go in there? I'm not good at this! We all know I'll die!",
4,,,,Hoe Bean aggressively throws his spray can at Bex.,
5,,Hoe Bean,Angry,It's not like we have much of a choice. We have nothing!,

21,,,,You all haphazardly toss your objects at equipment.,
22,,Bex,Angry,I fucking hate it here.,

24,,,,"Bex isn't so happy about it though, crying the whole time, just saying how much they crave death at this moment. You all think the ghost is trying to spite them.",
25,,,,"With the amount of false alarms, you're lead to think it's an Oni.",

25,,Hoe Bean,Neutral,Unlucky.,
26,,You,,We could cross off spirit box though.,
27,,Sam,Neutral,"Well, that just leaves us with... A lot.",
28,,,,You all sit and ponder.,
29,,You,,"Well, it's really active so it makes me think it could be an Oni with all those events. They kinda just like to scare you. They're assholes like that.",
30,,Hoe Bean,Neutral,Oni then?,
