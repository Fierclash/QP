0,,Bex,Sad,"Guys, I'm shaking in my boots. This is so much worse than before. I'm scared.",
1,,Hoe Bean,Angry,"Bro, you've said that five times already and we've only stepped one foot inside the location.",
2,,Bex,Angry,"Fuck you, man! Ghosty, supernatural shit gets to me.",
3,,Hoe Bean,Angry,Fuckin' baby.,
4,,Bex,Angry,"Yes, I am!",
5,,You,,"It's okay, Bex, I will hold your hand.",
6,,Bex,Sad,"Thank you, Quinoa...",
7,,,,You hear Sam call in the distance.,
8,,Sam,Neutral,I think I found the ghost room!,
9,,,,"You all venture further inside, the door becoming a distant memory as you all steadily approach impending doom.",
10,,Sam,Neutral,I got freezing temps in here.,
11,,Hoe Bean,Neutral,"Oh, nice.",
12,,Bex,Neutral,"Okay, so... How do we pull out the journal again to mark it?",
13,,You,,You have to - ,
14,,,,Your vision flickers. You hear a familiar tune sung creepily which can only mean - ,
15,,Sam,Sad,"Hide, hide, hide!",
16,,Bex,Sad,Waahh...,
17,,Hoe Bean,Sad,I don't remember seeing any hiding spots.,
18,,Bex,Sad,"I'm die, thank you forever...",
19,,You,,"Wait, wait!",
20,,,,Everything stops. You're all alive.,
21,,You,,I think it was just a ghost event.,
22,,Hoe Bean,Neutral,That was a close. What setting do we have this on? Because I swear there's basically zero places we can hide.,
23,,Sam,Neutral,I'm pretty sure we put it to Professional. We tried Nightmare without Mike once and oof... ,
24,,Bex,Sad,"I'd like to go on record that I am not a professional and very much unqualified, so I think I should leave. You guys agree? Cool, I'll just - ",
25,,Hoe Bean,Neutral,"No, no, no. You're staying. We're all in this together.",
26,,You,,We should go back though. At least to check our sanity and maybe get a crucifix.,
27,,Sam,Neutral,That makes sense. I want to grab a UV stick too.,
28,,Bex,Happy,So we're leaving.,
29,,Hoe Bean,Neutral,For now. ,
30,,Bex,Happy,"Regardless, we're leaving.",
31,,Sam,Neutral,Where was the exit again?,
32,,You,,"I got it. Follow me, tomodachi.",
33,,,,"You lead your group toward safety, away from the darkness, to take temporary solace in the truck.",
34,,,,"However, as you pass through the doors -",
35,,Bex,Sad,WAAHHHH!!,
36,,,,You turn around to see the door closed on Bex.,
37,,,,"More specifically, Hoe Bean closing the door on Bex.",
38,,Sam,Happy,That's so fucked up!,
39,,Hoe Bean,Happy,Hehehehehe.,
40,,Bex,Sad,Hhhhhhh....,
41,,You,,It's not a hunt! You can open the door.,
42,,Bex,Sad,Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...,
43,,,,"The door opens, revealing a traumatized Bex. Well, you assume anyway. These models are wacky. You hope they never change.",
44,,,,"She sprints forward, wanting as much distance between her and the door as possible.",
45,,Bex,Sad,I hate this fucking game.,
46,,Hoe Bean,Happy,"Ha, fuckin' loser.",
47,,Bex,Angry,Fuck you! You get in there. I'll shut the door on your face. See how you like it!,
48,,Hoe Bean,Happy,Yeah? It's not like I'll be screaming like you though.,
49,,Bex,Angry,Fuck you.,
50,,,,"You watch Hoe Bean sprint inside and dance in the doorway - Well, I guess crouch and stand repeatedly by the doorway?",
51,,Hoe Bean,Happy,"Oooooh, ghosty, you wanna come out so bad, ooooooh. Everyone knows your gay anyway!",
52,,,,The door shuts.,
53,,Sam,Happy,Did you shut the door on him?,
54,,Bex,Neutral,"No, I -",
55,,Hoe Bean,Sad,"AHH, WHAT THE FU - ",
56,,,,The door opens. Hoe Bean's dead body lies in front of it. Ass up with no dignity.,
57,,Sam,Happy,"Oh, shit!",
58,,You,,"Damn, the ghost didn't like that one.",
59,,Bex,Happy,Deserved.,
60,,Sam,Neutral,Is the ghost homophobic?,
61,,You,,"Maybe like a closeted homophobe, ya know?",
62,,Sam,Neutral,"Oh, yeah. Probably still working it out.",
63,,,,A moment of silence passes as you all stare at the ghost's handiwork of Hoe Bean's ass. You wonder is this is gonna be a trend. ,
64,,You,,"Oh, right.",
65,,,,You quickly snap a phot of Hoe Bean's dead body.,
